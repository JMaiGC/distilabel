# Instruction generation

Collecting a set of high-quality instructions or user queries is a key activity for LLM fine-tuning and evaluation. 

This guide shows you how to build an instruction dataset for your use case.

## Self Instruct
Inspired by methods like Self-instruct or Alpaca, distilabel offers a flexible `generator` for generating instructions. The instructions are generated by a `generator` LLM based and driven by user-defined inputs. 

First, we need to configure a `SelfInstructTask`:
```python
from distilabel.tasks.text_generation import SelfInstructTask

self_instruct = SelfInstructTask(
    application_description="An AI application to generate tables",
    num_instructions=10
)
```
The `application_description` guides the `generator` to create
